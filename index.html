<h1>Kai Sanchez-Warner</h1>
<h2>About me!</h2>

<p>I am a musician, a people's person, a trying optimist, 
    a lover of food and I love connecting with and learning more about 
    awesome people, whether it's family, friends, or 
    strangers! I often spend my time making music - writing, 
    recording, and producing songs. I explore and blend a 
    variety of different genres in my music, including rock, 
    soul/r&b, blues, and dance music. If I'm not creating or 
    dancing to music, you'll probably find me spending time with friends 
     and family, eating food, or watching youtube videos 
     on history, science, philosophy, and politics.</p>
